        Hi, my name is Antonio, and I enjoy building things: web applications,
        software development teams, prototypes, documents, products,
        abstractions, songs, cooking recipes, instructionals, anything. I
        genuinely enjoy my work; it truly blows my mind that I get paid to learn
        and build things all day.

        Some years ago, as a college student, a friend and I founded a web
        software development company which a marketing firm later acquired.
        Unfortunately, this entrepreneurship experience was more educational
        than lucrative. The good news is that this venture helped me define how
        I want to work and what I need to facilitate for my coworkersâ€”integrity,
        empathy, ethics, compassion, kindness, transparency, inclusion,
        diversity, tolerance, and respect. We are most productive and efficient
        when we are diverse and healthy in mind, body, and spirit. We need to
        care for each other if we will work so hard every day. I see you. You
        are all working so hard.

        The marketing agency life was very fun and appealing to me. I will miss
        all the variability of the projects, their scope, and their features.
        The people you work with are brilliant too. The wild client feedback and
        how quick turnarounds were. We'd have to learn a language, library,
        framework, or protocol (!!) on the go because the client wanted us to do
        X, Y, and Z. What?! I loved that feeling and delivering felt even more
        remarkable. I learned to love learning.{" "}

        Throughout my career, I've held many responsibilities: Individual
        Contributor, Architect, Chief Technology Officer, Engineering Manager,
        and Director to a few teams, projects, and products with various levels
        of effort and impact. Nowadays, I'm enjoying my work as a Technical
        Product Owner for the digital core technology group in a fantastic
        Global tool and hardware company.

        Aside from work, I try to put most of my efforts into being a conscious
        and present person. I enjoy bringing my family together with food and
        sweets. I want to be a loving, mindful, and involved parent, a better
        husband, and a healthier person and neighbor. I want to be a better
        friend, brother, and son. I declare this today publicly to pressure
        myself.
